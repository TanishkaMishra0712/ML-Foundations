# ML Foundations

This repository contains my foundational learning and revision work
for Machine Learning.

Contents:
- NumPy: array operations, broadcasting, vectorization
- Pandas: data manipulation and cleaning
- Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn basics

These notebooks are structured for concept clarity and future revision.
More content will be added progressively.
